# Student Marks Prediction Project

📝 Description
This project is my first end-to-end machine learning model. The goal is to predict a student's exam score based on the number of hours they studied.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

 📈 Results
The final trained model uses the formula: **Score = 5.68 * Hours_Studied + 37.73** to make predictions. The visualization below shows how accurately the model's prediction line fits the actual data.
